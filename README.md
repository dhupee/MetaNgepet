# Small Problem I've encounter
* This problem is a minor yet sometimes annoying for me, config for jupyter isn't running for the `timestamp` part, should be a problem but could be a inconvinince.

* wrong timeframe setting can break the scaler with `ValueError: Input contains infinity or a value too large for dtype('float64')` Error.

* making a simple backtest just to see if it's useful.
