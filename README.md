# Major rebuild ~~coming soon~~ is on the way
## To-do list:
* [x] adding config.py file setting (try to make it proper if i want to make it public)
* [x] using basic regression from sklearn
* [ ] modifying the feature function for my need and timeframe
* [ ] making signal function for trading bot
* [ ] try make a proper bot by combining it with regression model
* [ ] investigate `one code for all` vs `single ticker single code`
* [ ] learn how to make proper Readme

# How to Use This Bot?
"coming soon hehe"

# Dependencies
Just execute this command or uncomment the command on the first cell of the Training Notebook
```
pip install -U MetaTrader5 matplotlib numpy pandas pandas_ta pickle scikit-learn
```

# Config.py Template
```
coming soon, promise
```

# Small Problem I've encounter
* This problem is a minor yet sometimes annoying for me, config for jupyter isn't running for the `timestamp` part, should be a problem but could be a inconvinince.

* wrong timeframe setting can break the scaler with `ValueError: Input contains infinity or a value too large for dtype('float64')` Error.

* making a simple backtest just to see if it's useful.
